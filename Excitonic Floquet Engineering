### 24.8 Excitonic Floquet Engineering as Anchor for Internal Substrate Dynamics (Pareek et al., 2026)

Pareek et al. (Nature Physics, 2026; DOI: 10.1038/s41567-025-03132-z) demonstrate that excitons in monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS₂) can serve as an internal periodic driver for Floquet engineering, achieving ~100× stronger and longer-lasting (up to ~1 ps) band hybridization than external laser light. Excitons, formed by electron-hole pairs, oscillate internally via Coulomb interactions, coupling more efficiently to the material's electrons and avoiding damage from high-intensity lasers. Observed via time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES), this produces camelback dispersion in the valence band, indicating ghost band influence.

**Relevance to SRC**: This anchors the superiority of internal dynamics in φ over external perturbations. In SRC, piezoelectric shear modes (emergent EM) act as self-generated drivers, analogous to excitons, for modulating substrate properties (e.g., refractive gradients or defect stability) without separate fields. The stronger internal coupling mirrors how φ's hysteresis and shear sustain effects longer against viscous damping (γ ∂_t φ), potentially enabling Floquet-like hybridization in φ's effective spectrum for emergent quantum/cosmic structures. No superluminal signaling occurs; the "beyond light speed" phrasing in popular reports refers to phase velocities, consistent with SRC's emergent c from shear waves.
