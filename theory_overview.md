# Scalar Relaxation Cosmology: Theory Overview

## 1. The Eternal Scalar Field
The foundation is an eternal real/complex scalar field φ(x, t), governed by relaxation dynamics. No creation event—the field has always existed.

## 2. Relaxation Dynamics
Governing equation:

∂²φ/∂t² + γ ∂φ/∂t - c² ∇²φ + λ (φ² - v²)² + ε φ = 0

**Parameter Definitions**:
- γ > 0: Damping rate (gravity emergence).
- λ: Nonlinearity strength (double-well potential for soliton stability).
- v: Vacuum expectation value (potential minima scale).
- ε: Tiny tilt (symmetry breaking for asymmetry).

Cosmic expansion: Wave spreading and damping, redshift from energy loss. Simulation example: A 1D Gaussian initial disturbance damps and flattens over t=10 units (code in `code/simulation_example.py`; see `code/kg_damping_plot.png` for ~50% amplitude reduction, spreading by factor of 2).

## 3. Particles as Vortices/Toroids
Subatomic particles: Topological defects in φ (or complex ψ).
- Electron/photon: Toroidal vortex.
  - Spin (azimuthal): Electric field divergence.
  - Axial flow (pole-to-pole): Magnetic field curl.
- Mass: Bound energy E = ∫ |∇φ|² dV ≈ ħ c / R (R = major radius, derivable from topology).
- E=mc²: Unwinding (radiation) or spinning up (matter).

## 4. Forces as Emergent Resonances
- Gravity: Sympathetic alignment of vortices (amplifies damping).
- EM: Toroidal mode (detailed in toroidal EM section).
- Strong/Weak: Higher windings/asymmetries (future: derive quark masses via multi-vortex bindings).

## 5. Unification and Resolutions
SRC bypasses singularities, dark sectors, etc.

## 6. Quantum Aspects
- Wavefunction: Vortex phase θ.
- Collapse: Damping to minimum energy state.
- Entanglement: Shared topological windings.
