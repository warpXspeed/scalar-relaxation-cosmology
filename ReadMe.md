# Scalar Relaxation Cosmology (SRC)

**An Eternal Scalar Field Theory Unifying Gravity, Electromagnetism, Particles, and Cosmology**

Scalar Relaxation Cosmology proposes a unified framework where the universe emerges from a single, eternal scalar field φ—the "quiet lake"—disturbed by a primordial wave that slowly relaxes toward equilibrium. No Big Bang singularity, no dark energy, no dark matter particles—everything arises from field dynamics: relaxation damping, resonant vortices, and topological toroids.

### Core Principles
- The universe is eternal and cyclic, with relaxation solving the cosmological constant problem dynamically.
- Particles are stable vortices/eddies in the scalar field, reviving Kelvin's vortex atoms in modern contexts.
- Forces emerge from resonance and topology:
  - Gravity: Global relaxation damping (γ term).
  - Electromagnetism: Toroidal vortices with spin (electric) and axial flow (magnetic).
- Quantum effects: From field fluctuations and vortex jitter, with topology ensuring stability.

### Key Equation
The scalar field obeys a damped Klein-Gordon equation with nonlinear terms:

∂²φ/∂t² + γ ∂φ/∂t - c² ∇²φ + λ (φ² - v²)² + ε φ = 0

**Parameter Definitions**:
- γ > 0: Damping rate (emergence of gravity via energy loss).
- λ: Nonlinearity strength (double-well potential for soliton stability).
- v: Vacuum expectation value (scale of potential minima).
- ε: Tiny tilt (for asymmetry and symmetry breaking).

### How SRC Addresses Mainstream Problems
- No Big Bang singularity: Eternal field.
- No dark energy: Nonlinear relaxation mimics acceleration.
- No dark matter: Vortex clustering mimics halos.
- Quantum gravity: Emergent from vortex topology.
