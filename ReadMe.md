# Scalar Relaxation Cosmology (SRC)

**An Eternal Scalar Field Theory Unifying Gravity, Electromagnetism, Particles, and Cosmology**

Scalar Relaxation Cosmology proposes a unified framework where the universe emerges from a single, eternal scalar field φ—the "quiet lake"—disturbed by a primordial wave that slowly relaxes toward equilibrium. No Big Bang singularity, no dark energy, no dark matter particles—everything arises from field dynamics: relaxation damping, resonant vortices, and topological toroids.

### Core Principles
- The universe is eternal and cyclic, with relaxation solving the cosmological constant problem dynamically [1].
- Particles are stable vortices/eddies in the scalar field, reviving Kelvin's vortex atoms in modern contexts [19, 20].
- Forces emerge from resonance and topology:
  - Gravity: Global relaxation damping (γ term) [6].
  - Electromagnetism: Toroidal vortices with spin (electric) and axial flow (magnetic) [11, 14].
- Quantum effects: From field fluctuations and vortex jitter, with topology ensuring stability [26].

### Key Equations
The scalar field obeys a damped Klein-Gordon equation with nonlinear terms [1][6]:
