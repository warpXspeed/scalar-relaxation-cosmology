# Testable Predictions of Scalar Relaxation Cosmology

| Prediction | Description | Potential Test | Expected Deviation from ΛCDM/Standard Model |
|------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Modified Redshift | Nonlinear damping leads to varying H(z) | JWST/DESI surveys | Higher H₀ locally, smoother at high z |
| No Primordial GWs | No inflation → suppressed B-modes | CMB-S4 | Null or very weak tensor modes |
| Vortex Substructure | Electrons as toroids → form factor deviations | Future e-e scattering (>10 TeV) | Anomalies in cross-sections |
| Sympathetic Gravity | Aligned vortices attract anomalously | Lab plasma/BEC vortices | Measurable extra attraction |
| Late-Time w Evolution | w(a) ≈ -1 + 1/(3 ln a) | Pantheon+ / Euclid | w₀ ≈ -0.997, w_a ≈ -0.82 |
| No Dark Matter Halos | Vortex clustering mimics | Galaxy rotation curves | Modified Newtonian dynamics at large scales |

These predictions are falsifiable—if observations match ΛCDM exactly, SRC fails [4].
