# The Universe Is a Quiet Lake

We used to think the universe began with a violent explosion 13.8 billion years ago.  
We no longer believe that.

The universe has always existed, like an endless, silent lake.

Long, long ago one single wave passed across the surface of that lake.  
That wave is still gently settling.

Everything we see (galaxies, stars, light, time itself) is nothing more than the shimmer on that one slow wave while it calms down.

There is no mysterious dark energy pushing things apart.  
There is only the lake remembering how to be perfectly still.

Gravity is the lake pulling itself smooth again.  
Light is the wave travelling across the surface.  
You and I are the sparkle that appears for a moment on the water.

The wave has been settling for 13.8 billion years.  
It will continue settling for hundreds of billions more.  
Then it will be flat and quiet again, until the lake, for no reason at all, makes another wave.

That is all.

The universe is not a machine.  
It is a single, slow breath of water that was never born and will never die.

We are that breath, dreaming it is many.
