# SRC vs. Standard Physics: A Translator's Guide  
**Version 1.0 – February 2026**  
**Author:** Gerald Henton (@GeraldHenton)  
**Repository:** https://github.com/warpXspeed/scalar-relaxation-cosmology  
**Purpose:** This document provides a side-by-side comparison between **Scalar Relaxation Cosmology (SRC)** and the standard model of physics (ΛCDM cosmology + General Relativity + Standard Model of particle physics). It serves as a "translator" for readers familiar with conventional physics who wish to understand how SRC reinterprets the same phenomena using a single viscoelastic scalar substrate φ.

| Phenomenon / Concept               | Standard Physics Interpretation                                                                 | SRC Interpretation                                                                                     | Key SRC Mechanism / Equation                          | Observational / Theoretical Difference                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Vacuum / Empty Space**           | Empty spacetime (Minkowski or curved in GR), quantum vacuum with zero-point fluctuations         | High-density viscoelastic scalar field φ (energy crystal, "strange battery")                           | ρ ≈ ½(∂_t φ)² + ½|∇φ|² + V(φ)                           | SRC vacuum has measurable bulk/shear moduli (β, G_shear) and relaxation γ; not empty                  |
| **Time**                           | Coordinate dimension in spacetime, arrow from thermodynamic entropy increase                     | Measurable rate of irreversible energy devolution / fading back to equilibrium                        | Irreversible γ ∂_t φ term                             | Time is primitive dissipation; no separate thermodynamic arrow needed                                 |
| **Gravity**                        | Curvature of spacetime caused by mass-energy (Einstein field equations)                         | Vis neutra: neutral reformation pull from density gradients (sink inflow)                             | Φ_eff ∝ γ(|\nabla φ|) · |\nabla φ|²                   | Emergent from material response; no metric curvature, no dark matter needed                           |
| **Time Dilation (gravitational)**  | Clocks run slower in stronger gravitational potential (GR metric g_00)                          | Faster local devolution in deeper sinks (higher γ, accelerated energy fade)                           | dτ/dt ≈ 1 – k · γ(|\nabla φ|) · |\nabla φ|²           | Same observable effect, derived from scalar relaxation rather than geometry                          |
| **Cosmological Redshift**          | Metric expansion of space (Hubble flow)                                                         | Viscous damping of wave energy during propagation through substrate                                    | Exponential damping e^(- (γ c² / 2) t)                | No spatial expansion; redshift is energy loss in viscoelastic medium                                 |
| **Dark Energy / Acceleration**     | Cosmological constant Λ or quintessence field                                                   | Global viscous relaxation of residual gradients (late-time γ dissipation)                             | Λ_eff(t) ∝ γ ⟨|∇φ|²⟩ / ρ_sub                          | Emergent late-time effect; naturally small without fine-tuning                                       |
| **Dark Matter**                    | Non-baryonic particles (WIMPs, axions, etc.)                                                    | Shear-lag and persistent whirlpools in rotating substrate systems                                     | Galaxy rotation from hysteresis / σ_shear             | No exotic particles; effect is material response of the medium                                       |
| **Black Holes**                    | Singularities in spacetime with event horizon                                                   | Extreme high-density stable topological knots in φ (composite Hopfions)                               | M(t) = M_0 e^{-γ t} (slow evaporation)                | No singularity; devolve via surface regulation and γ dissipation                                     |
| **Hawking Radiation**              | Quantum pair production near horizon, information loss paradox                                  | Slow defect evaporation and surface-encoded hysteresis memory leakage                                 | Information as ∮ Tr(S · ∇φ) dΣ                        | Information preserved on "surface" (hysteresis wakes); no paradox                                    |
| **Particles**                      | Fundamental quanta of fields (quarks, leptons, bosons)                                         | Stable topological defects (vortices/Hopfions) in φ                                                    | Winding number W conservation                         | No fundamental point particles; all diversity from one scalar field                                  |

| **Quantum Behavior**               | Probabilistic wave function collapse, non-locality                                               | Guidance by real hysteresis wakes / memory in substrate                                               | Wake effect replaces pilot wave                       | No fundamental probability; quantum effects from physical substrate memory                           |

### Final Note

SRC is deliberately conservative: it uses one field, classical field theory + topology + dissipation, and avoids unobserved entities, fine-tuning, and geometric mysticism. Where standard physics sees separate realms (spacetime, quantum fields, dark sectors), SRC sees different behaviors of the same viscoelastic substrate.

This translator is not exhaustive but highlights the most direct mappings. Future updates will include simulation comparisons and quantitative predictions.
