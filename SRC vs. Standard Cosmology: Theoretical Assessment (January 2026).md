# SRC vs. Standard Cosmology: Theoretical Assessment (January 2026)

Scalar Relaxation Cosmology (SRC) proposes the observable universe as a transient viscoelastic relaxation within a single high-density scalar substrate field φ. It derives gravity, electromagnetism, particles, and redshift from substrate properties (density gradients, shear, viscosity) — without metric expansion, a Big Bang singularity, or separate dark components.

### Internal Theoretical Coherence
The model is mathematically consistent as a classical field theory:
- Gravity emerges as refractive index gradients + effective pressure.
- EM as piezoelectric shear modes.
- Particles as stable topological defects (vortices/Hopfions).
- Quantum features from hysteresis and wake effects.
- Redshift via viscous damping (γ ∂_t φ term).

This unification reproduces many GR and QM phenomena mechanistically, without probabilistic or geometric primitives.

### Key Resolutions of Standard-Model Tensions
- Vacuum energy discrepancy → active relaxation; only residual fluctuations observed.
- Dark matter → substrate shear-lag / whirlpool drag in galactic disks.
- Dark energy → irreversible global viscous relaxation of initial perturbation.
- Quantum non-locality & wave-particle duality → physical wakes guiding defects (no collapse required).

### Empirical Anchors & Falsifiability
SRC aligns with several condensed-matter / high-energy analogs (see Technical Manual section 24 for details):
- Ice flexoelectricity (Wen et al. 2025) — simulated in `scripts/ice_flexo_analog.py`.
- Emergent topological semimetal at Kondo QCP (Kirschbaum et al. 2026).
- Superfluid ^3He second-sound modes as proxy for damping equation.
- Photonic contextuality in high dimensions (Liu et al. 2025).

Testable distinctions vs. ΛCDM include:
- Frequency-dependent GW damping (spectral tilt) — future detectors (LIGO-India, mid-2026+).
- Vacuum birefringence near magnetars / high-stress objects.
- Possible fine-structure constant variations from galactic density wakes.
- Supernova time-dilation via differential damping (rather than expansion).

The model reinterprets the CMB as resonant substrate modes rather than a hot Big Bang relic.

### Current Standing
SRC offers a deterministic, unified alternative with internal mathematical robustness and preliminary analog support from lab physics. Quantitative sims (e.g., emergent light speed in `scripts/`) achieve high precision for targeted observables.

However, it diverges from broad cosmological consensus on expansion history, CMB origin, and structure formation. Full validation requires matching precision data on the predictions above (e.g., GW dispersion, birefringence). Ongoing work focuses on refining simulations and cross-checks with anchors.
